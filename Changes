Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
          Moved to Moose 0.90
          Dropped need for MXHS.
          Added (private) accessors for everything moose can do on the ::Private core.
            This is soley to discourage consumers from accesing the hash internals directly
            to provide better encapsulation. Maybe one day ::Private will be entirely replaced with 
            XS and you want it to remain working.
          Tweaked dist.ini because I made it wrong -_-.

          Moved last_id to last_index ( was a bad name anyway )
          Added ->indices to the KeyCount plug. 
          Added KeyPlug tests.
          This is a minor release to tweak -last_index prior to S::F release

          Added a plugin infrastructure w/ Roles.
          Moved ->count to role composition ( you wont notice this )
          Increased input strictness with really basic MX::Types based input validation.
           ( if you're going to be using _key or _at methods, use them properly ! :) )
          Added ->last_id via Counter plug.
          Moved the non-working sorting routines to a plug. Maybe they'll see some love there.
